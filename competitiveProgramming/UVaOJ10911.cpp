/*
Let (x, y) be the integer coordinates of a studentâ€™s house on a 2D plane. There are 2N students and we want to pair them into N groups. Let di be the distance between the houses of 2 students in group i. Form N groups such that cost = sum of di from i=1 to N is minimized. Output the minimum cost as a floating point number with 2 digits precision in one line. Constraints: 1 <= N <= 8 and 0 <= x, y <= 1000.
Sample input (with explanation):
N = 2; Coordinates of the 2N = 4 houses are {1, 1}, {8, 6}, {6, 8}, and {1, 3}.
Sample output (with explanation):
cost = 4.83.
