# Understand the content of the problems
Try to come up with some examples and use it to form some approach to the problems.

# Use one of your most used language
You can use mathematic language to describe the abstract of each problem throught its relation.

# Idenftify the data structure of the problems
We use top-down approach to reduce the complexity of the problem, goes to abstract to specific, from brief to detail

# Use your preferred programming language
In this step, we use bottom-up approach to go from small step into big step such as combinate operation. Reuse examples from step 1 to test.
